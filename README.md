# Example clients for working with the AIA Emissions Calculators API

The [AIA Environmental Accounting Platform (EAP)](https://www.aiaeap.com/) is an on-farm GHG emissions calculation engine developed by [Agricultural Innovation Australia](https://aginnovationaustralia.com.au). Free access to AIA’s open-source code is supported by the Australian Government through funding from the _Improving Consistency of On-Farm Emissions Estimates Program_.

This repo contains examples and sample code that make it easy to start working with the Emissions Calculators REST API that is part of the AIA EAP.

# Examples

The repo currently includes fully documented and automatically generated API clients for C#, JavaScript, PHP and Python. See each example folder for detailed documentation. The goal is to supply scripts that allow you to either:
- use the source code in the example clients straight away
- code generate your own client for working with the API

Each example has a script that can run and execute a succesful calculation, they typically jsut require configuring your client certificate files. They also include a script that is generating the client directly from the OpenAPI file for the API.

# Contributing and support

If you are looking for help using the tools available here, there are a number of resources available to you.

First of all, we aim to make the tools as easy to use as possible out of the box, and for users to be able to self service their own questions. Documentation for consuming the REST API is available online [here](https://docs.aiaplatform.com.au).

If you still have a question, feel free to [open a github issue](https://github.com/aginnovationaustralia/emissions-calculators-examples/issues/new) and fill in the template with as much context as possible. We aim to have a response to your question within 48 hours.
